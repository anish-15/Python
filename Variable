## code to demonstrate variable assignment
a = 5
# printing value of a 
print ("The value of a is: " + str(a)) 
# Output: The value of a is: 5



## Program to swap two variables in single line 
x = 5
y = 10
x, y = y, x 
print (x, y) 
# Output: (10,5)



## Program to show that the variables with a value
class Student:
    # Class Variable (variable define during class declaration)
    stream = 'cs'
    # The init method or constructor 
    def __init__(self, roll):
        # Instance Variable (variable which are assigned values inside class methods)
        self.roll = roll       
# Objects of class
a = Student(10)
b = Student(20)
print(a.stream)  # Output: "cs"
print(a.roll)  # Output: 10
# Class variables can be accessed by using class name also
print(Student.stream)  # Output: "cs"
